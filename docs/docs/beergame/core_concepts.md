# Core Concepts

- **Lead Time**: This represents the delay between placing an order and receiving the beer. The longer the lead time, the more difficult it becomes to forecast demand accurately, leading to the potential for overstocking or understocking.
- **Bullwhip Effect**: A central lesson of the beer game. The bullwhip effect refers to how small fluctuations in customer demand can cause increasingly larger fluctuations in orders as they move up the supply chain. The further you are from the customer (e.g., at the factory level), the more extreme the variation in orders becomes.
- **Collaboration**: Successful players must anticipate not just their immediate needs but also the needs of others in the chain. Communication and understanding of the overall system help mitigate the bullwhip effect.
