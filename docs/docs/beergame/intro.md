# Game Overview
The beer simulation game is a dynamic supply chain management exercise designed to illustrate the complexities of supply and demand coordination. It aims to demonstrate key concepts in logistics inventory management and the "bullwhip effect" in supply chains. Each player takes on a different role in the beer supply chain, working to optimize their operations by minimizing costs and ensuring steady product flow.

The game typically simulates several rounds where each player manages their segment of the supply chain, adjusting orders and deliveries to meet fluctuating customer demand.
